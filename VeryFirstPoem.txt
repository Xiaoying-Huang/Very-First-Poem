Very First Poem
This is my very first poem
that is ever created on Github.
It is very short
but hopefully interesting.

Oh this is so funny,
look at you so crazy,
trying to make money,
and then become so wealthy.

The poem is getting longer,
but our life is not.
The days get shorter in winter,
but my lights are getting darker.
Yes, I need to change battery.
