Very First Poem
This is my very first poem
that is ever created on Github.
It is very short
but hopefully interesting.

No one is born a poet,
but everyone can be quiet.
When you release silence,
you will end nonsense.

Oh it is so funny,
look at you so crazy,
trying to make money,
and then become so wealthy.

Can you think of a name,
that is neither too beautiful,
nor too ugly;
neither too old and rusty,
nor too young or naive.
